# PHP Calculator

This project was my introduction to PHP. Initially it was quite confusing on how to handle POST and GET forms but Google saved the day. I was able to figure out how to handle POST using the isset function and getting variables using $_POST, etc. Most of the time spent on this project was on figuring out design and how to use CSS to format the calculator. I need to practice and study up on the how to get better at formatting for websites. Currently, this calculator does not look great on mobile devices so I hope to come back to this project to make it mobile friendly as well!

## Disclaimer
The above project is guided by WashU's CSE330 course.

I am doing these projects independentally to grow as a web developer and am challenging myself to elevate the assignment by not only checking off what needs to be done, but by adding new functionality, good user interaction, and overall design.
